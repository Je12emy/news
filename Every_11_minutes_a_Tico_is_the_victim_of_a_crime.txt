QCOSTARICA — Every 11 minutes and 24 seconds, a Costa Rican is a victim of a 
crime. By October 3 of this year, the Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ) 
– Judicial Investigation Agency – had reported 35,331 criminal acts, including 
thefts, robberies, assaults, vehicle tampering, and homicides.

the number of homicides is at an all-time high 
 
Theft is the most significant type of crime, with over 12,000 cases reported.
 
Costa Rica has fewer reported crimes this year in comparison to the same period 
last year – 37,455 – but the crimes are more violent in nature.

Little big detail
 
The big difference or contrast between last year and this year is not the 
reduction in cases, but the increase in violence; a wave of violence without 
parallel in its history.
 
By October 3, the country registered 683 homicides, while for the same period 
last year, only 473 cases were recorded.
 
The worst of all is that the country has already reached a historical record in 
homicides and with three months to go before the end of the year, the projection
of homicides is 900.

For example, the province of Limón already has a homicide rate of 35.3 per 
100,000 inhabitants, a record higher than that of Mexico, reporting in 2022, 
25.2 murders in the same number of residents.
 
If the Caribbean province were a separate country, statistics from the World 
Bank and InSight Crime suggest that it could rank as the third most dangerous in
the Americas, behind Venezuela and Honduras. This analysis does not include 
Caribbean nations.

with the rise in homicides. 
 
A week ago, four men were shot when they were near the old Calipso Hall in a 
vehicle in downtown Limón. In this case, authorities counted more than 100 
point-blank shots.
 
The violence of this crime is reflective of a conflict between drug trafficking 
groups concerning territory and illegal drug transportation routes, which has 
resulted in the number of murders in the province rising from 118 to 166 between
September 2022 and September 2023, an increase of 40%.
 
Given this situation, Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves proposed to the 
authorities of the Judiciary and the Legislative Assembly to accelerate several 
legal proposals, among them limits on the granting of precautionary measures, 
adapting the response of juvenile criminal justice, authorizing wiretapping for 
homicides and femicides, increased sanctions for the use of weapons, and 
extraditions.
 
Limit on the granting of precautionary measures
The aim is to limit the granting of precautionary measures, such as house arrest
with electronic monitoring (ankle bracelets), only for crimes that carry 
penalties of less than four years in prison.
 
In this way, people with a criminal history of major crimes such as rape, drug 
trafficking, organized crime, and homicides, will not be able granted 
precautionary measures outside of prison.
 
Sicarios (hitmen) and minors
In this case, it is about adapting the response of juvenile criminal justice to 
the challenges of violent crime and organized crime.
 
The idea is that justice can address in a differentiated manner those matters 
related to organized crime in which (increasingly) minors participate, in 
addition to expanding the list of crimes where the statute of limitations is 
five years, incorporating those crimes considered serious, and include as 
grounds for provisional detention when a minor ‘represents a danger to society.
 
Communications Intervention or wiretapping
Telephone intervention is authorized for the crimes of simple homicide and 
femicide; Likewise, it is proposed that the Attorney General’s Office may 
request the intervention of communications.
 
In addition, it extends the period of the intervention to four months, with the 
possibility of two extensions up to a maximum of 1 year of intervention.
 
Increased sanctions for the use of weapons
The idea is to establish as an aggravating circumstance in crimes of illegal 
possession of weapons those cases in which the person possesses or carries a 
firearm that is registered in the name of a third party and that has been 
reported as lost or stolen.
 
On the other hand, the penalty will increase when that weapon has been used to 
commit a criminal offense or falls within any of the cases of organized crime or
illicit association.
 
Extradition of Costa Ricans
It is a reform to the country’s Constitution to enable the extradition of Costa 
Rican people in cases of international drug trafficking or terrorism.
